/*
 * 10,000 Dice Game Rules: (2+ players)
 
 * To start the game:
    * Each player rolls a die to determine who rolls first

 * Playing the game:
    * Player rolls 6 dice
        * Check for single 1s and 5s, three or more-of-a-kinds, or straights
            * single 1 = 100pts, single 5 = 50pts
            * three-of-a-kind = num*100pts (1s are exception = 1000pts) doubling with 4-of-a-kind and so on
            * straight = 1200pts, three pairs = 600pts
        * Set aside scoring dice
        * End turn by adding pts or a roll that scored 0 pts
            * To earn continuing pts, the player MUST roll 1000pts on one round
            * If all dice have been rolled on a turn and they score pts for the player, the player MUST roll all 6 at least one more time
* To win the game:
    * First player to score 10,000pts wins. Each other player gets one extra attempt to beat that player's score if possible
        * Keep a track of what all players score
